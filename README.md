# VRSpaceGUI
--------------
This repo is for a simple (and hopefully growing to be more advanced) GUI for accessing user projects through UI. These projects are executables that are locally stored on the hard drive. 

The system uses multiple models. One is using HTML (Only works via ActiveX and on Internet Explorer). 
There is another coming soon that is basic Python GUI with Tkinter and hopefully will be upgraded to something else (TBD).
